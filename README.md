# ros-colour-pub-sub
A simple ROS Noetic workspace demonstrating custom message creation and usage in Python. Defines a colour.msg with RGBA and name fields, builds it using catkin_make, and implements a publisher node to broadcast colour data and a subscriber node to receive and display it. Great for beginners learning ROS topics.
