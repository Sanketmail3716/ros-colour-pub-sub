# ROS Colour Pub-Sub

A simple ROS Noetic example demonstrating how to create and use a **custom message** in Python.  
This project defines a `colour.msg` with RGBA and name fields, builds it with `catkin_make`,  
and includes a publisher node to broadcast colour data and a subscriber node to receive and print it.
